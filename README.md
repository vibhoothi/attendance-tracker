# Attendance Tracker
Attendance management is the act of managing attendance or presence in a work setting to minimize loss due to employee downtime.

Attendance control has traditionally been approached using time clocks, timesheets, and time tracking software, 
but attendance management goes beyond this to provide a working environment which maximizes and motivates employee attendance.
Recently it has become possible to collect attendance data automatically through using real-time location systems, 
which also allow for cross-linking between attendance data and performance.

Attendance management takes place in all educational campuses be they university, college or school.

A basic Attendance Tracker which uses JSP, JDBC and MySQL.


## Requirements 

For this software to work, we would require some specific changes and software to go ahead and work properly.
Following are the requirements:
  - Apache Netbeans IDE 11.1.
  - Visual Studio 1.36.
  - MySQL version 8.0.15.
  - MySQL Connector (JDBC) 5.1.48.
  - JSTL 1.2 jar file.
  - MySQL Connector Java Binary 8.0.15.

For running the software in the optimal way, we recommend to use 11.1 Version of Apache Netbeans IDE. The main use of VSCode is to support rapid development and modifications. The MySQL configuration inside in your system should have root user with database created according to the application. We should keep the jstl java runtime file  inside `/web/WEB-INF/lib/` directory. For the MySQLConnector and MySQL Connector Java Binary we would require to keep it in `build/web/WEB-INF/lib/`.
